rest-test
=========

A simple test client that makes it easy to test REST APIs with a GUI that stores all your settings: URL, method (GET, DELETE, POST, PUT), payload data.
The method and playload data settings are even associated with the URL in the settings, such that picking a previously used URL will automatically restore the other settings.
The response is shown in a multi-line text field, and if it's JSON, it's even neatly formatted.
